# EmployeeDirectory

## Description

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

- This app utilizes an API to populate random users and then create a directory. Other users on the app can search for employees by "name" and also organize each field (Name, Email, DOB) in ascending or descending order.
